# Blog Refresh - [Work in progress]
Blog Refresh is a program that will send the user a text with new content that has been published in the last day by tech blogs that the user follows.
# Motivation
Not all blogs have the ability to automatically notify its readers when new content is posted, and not all blogs are hosted on third-party platforms (e.g., Medium) that will do this for you. Therefore, Blog Refresh will web scrape blogs automatically each day and send the user a text with new content that has been published so the user doesn't have to do this manually.
